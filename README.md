# DS2_Take-Home
The task is to create the best possible model for predicting the popularity of a news article from mashable.com and perform best in a kaggle.com competition being held.

The data is from articles that appeared on the site two years past January 8, 2015 (when the dataset was acquired) or later. The goal is to predict which articles are shared the most on social media using the binary is_popular column within the dataset denoting an article being popular with a 1, 0 if not. From the competition, the data is already split into train.csv and test.csv with the latter being used to generate predictions on popularity for submission to the competition. train.csv will be split into training and test sets for creating and testing predictive models.

Please refer to the ipynb and pdf files for details on the project.
